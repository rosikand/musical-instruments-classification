# Musical Instruments Audio Classification 

In this repository, I experiment with different machine learning algorithms to classify audio samples of musical instruments.

### Data source

The raw audio files, in the `.wav` format, were downloaded from [here](https://github.com/seth814/Audio-Classification/tree/master/wavfiles). 

### Pipeline

1. Load in raw audio file (`.wav`) format. 
2. Sample the signal such that the resultant is discrete data. 
3. Convert to Mel Spectrogramâ€”resultant is an image.  
4. Save resultant image to respective directory. 
5. Repeat for all images. 

The resultant directories that contain the Mel Spectrograms are saved in this repository as well.
